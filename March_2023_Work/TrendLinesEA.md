# TrendLinesEA.mq5 (source code) / TrendLinesEA.ex5 (when compiled)

If like me you are too lazy to draw trendlines in Metatrader 5 then this EA will help you a lot !

This EA will help you find the more suitable trendline according to your criterias of choice.

[up arrow] to change the 2nd high to use for the 2nd point of the trendline (next high lower than the current one of the 2nd point).

[r] to reset (as when the EA is attached to the chart for the first time).

[c] to clear all objects.


For now it only draws upper trendlines.

# Tips

If you press the [up arrow] multiple times then at some time no more trendline could be drawn. In that case, press [r] to reset the trend line at its initial state.
