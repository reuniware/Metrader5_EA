# TrendLinesEA.mq5 (source code) / TrendLinesEA.ex (when compiled)

If like me you are too lazy to draw trendlines in Metatrader 5 then this EA will help you a lot !

[up arrow] : change the 2nd high to use for the 2nd point of the trendline

[r] to reset (as when the EA is attached to the chart for the first time)

[c] to clear all objects


For now it only draws upper trendlines.
